<h1>Project Description</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>I want to create a program that allows users to access their bank information, such as their balance, and also interact with each other. In this application, it will function as a basic bank application with a few extra details. For example, the users will be able to interact with each other directly.For example, users will be able to make transactions with each other that will directly change the balance within their bank. This way, the users are all online at once, but also allows for them to interact if they please. Perhaps a user can also request a certain amount to another user. The other use can then confirm the request and transfer the money over. This would be a good program for businesses and for freelance users. It would be like writing the other user a check.</p>

<h1>Project Design</h1>
  
<br>
  <br>
<p>I plan on using Spring MVC for this project as it is required. I plan on working on this project in netbeans on my laptop. I believe that this will allow me to complete this project easily due to the fact that I have worked with netbeans quite a lot. User’s will be able to access their bank statements and see their overall balance. The user’s self-interest to their bank account would be one of the project’s use cases. Another use case would be as I mentioned above. The user’s will want to make transactions with each other to exchange money. For example, perhaps one user is paying another for a job they had completed for them. Rather than giving them cash, they can directly connect with the user on the application and transfer the money to them. This would put it directly into the user’s bank. At the moment, I do not know if there are any other design docs that are necessary for me to understand the project. I believe that I will have to do more research into the matter before truly understanding what I need for this project and what I need to learn.

<h1>Project Schedule</h1>
<br>
  <br>
<p>
 Updating my Project Schedule after my first deliverable. I originally planned to have everything linked and running for this deliverable. Though, I realize I have a lot of things I have to work on and fix. At the moment, I have all the classes that I believe I will be using inside of the application. Though, I do not have all the classes completed yet, which is what I was originally planning for the 'layout' of the project. I did go into all the views and entered the html that I believed I wanted for the project so far. I plan on going into more detail for my next Project deliverable. This is because I do not have the application running just yet, and I do not have all the classes, especially the models and controllers, set up yet. 
 Not only that, but I still need to change over to Spring MVC, as I started in Maven. I am still not completely clear on Spring, so I will be going to office hours for this.
 <br>
 At check point 2, I want the basic actions to be set up, I want all my classes to be filled up some what. I want the check point at this point to be a good base for the final deliverable. 
 <br>
 At checkpoint 3, I want users to be able to interact with each other. At this point, the bulk of the project should be done. It should work without errors and flow fully. I plan on visiting office hours frequently in order to get the project to this point, as I am worried over all. I want them to be able to transfer money to each other’s bank account if the user accepts the transaction. I believe that this is one of the end goals of the project. 
 <br>Overall, the final project will look like a bank application that allows users to accept or decline transactions. Based on these transactions I want the user’s bank account to update directly.

<h1>Project Justification</h1>
<br>
  <br>
 <p>I find this project interesting because I believe it is something I can work on and get working well. I find the idea of the user’s account updating after each transaction to be something that people will be interested in using. I believe that this project is different because there are not many bank applications that allow users to accept or decline transactions like this. I believe that the closest application would be paypal. I believe people would use it because it allows for a quick and easy way to pay for something, without having to write a check or deliver cash to the person. I believe that this project will be a good showcase of my abilities because It allows me to try to achieve all of the things we have worked on in class. While I struggled in the labs, I believe that this project will help me build my skills over time.
