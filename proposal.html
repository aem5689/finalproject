<html><body> <h>1.	Project Description - What is the high level idea of your project? This should be similar to your daily log submission (but could have changed).</h>
a.	I plan on following one of the projects suggested in class a few weeks ago. I want to create a program that allows users to access their bank information, such as their balance, and also interact with each other. For example, users will be able to make transactions with each other that will directly change the balance within their bank. This way, the users are all online at once, but also allows for them to interact if they please. 

<h>2.	Project Design - lower-level description. a. What technologies will you use, how will they integrate? b. What are the project’s use cases? c. Any other design docs that are necessary for me to understand your project </h>
a.	I plan on using Spring MVC for this project as it is required. I plan on working on this project in netbeans on my laptop. I believe that this will allow me to complete this project easily due to the fact that I have worked with netbeans quite a lot. 
b.	User’s will be able to access their bank statements and see their overall balance. The user’s self-interest to their bank account would be one of the project’s use cases. Another use case would be as I mentioned above. The user’s will want to make transactions with each other to exchange money. For example, perhaps one user is paying another for a job they had completed for them. Rather than giving them cash, they can directly connect with the user on the application and transfer the money to them. This would put it directly into the user’s bank. 
c.	At the moment, I do not know if there are any other design docs that are necessary for me to understand the project. I believe that I will have to do more research into the matter before truly understanding what I need for this project and what I need to learn.

<h>3.	Project Schedule - what will you have done at each checkpoint? What will the final project look like? </h>
a.	At the moment, my project schedule isn’t fully laid out. I believe that I will establish this better when I talk with Jeremy about our project proposals. 
b.	I plan on having the base done for the checkpoint 1, for example being able to access all the pages that I have in mind in one way or another. Perhaps this can be set up through Spring MVC, with buttons or links.
c.	At checkpoint 2 I want most of the basic actions to be able to take place within the application. For example, I want the user to be able to log in and check their balance. I believe that this is a good base for checkpoint 2 overall.
d.	By checkpoint 3, I want the users to be able to interact with each other. I want them to be able to transfer money to each other’s bank account if the user accepts the transaction. I believe that this is one of the end goals of the project.
e.	Overall, the final project will look like a bank application that allows users to accept or decline transactions. Based on these transactions I want the user’s bank account to update directly. 

<h>4.	Project Justification - why is your project interesting? a. Novelty - why is your project different than existing applications, and why should people use it? b. Complexity - why is this project a good showcase of your abilities?</h>
a.	I find this project interesting because I believe it is something I can work on and get working well. I find the idea of the user’s account updating after each transaction to be something that people will be interested in using.
b.	I believe that this project is different because there are not many bank applications that allow users to accept or decline transactions like this. I believe that the closest application would be paypal. I believe people would use it because it allows for a quick and easy way to pay for something, without having to write a check or deliver cash to the person. 
c.	I believe that this project will be a good showcase of my abilities because It allows me to try to achieve all of the things we have worked on in class. While I struggled in the labs, I believe that this project will help me build my skills over time.
